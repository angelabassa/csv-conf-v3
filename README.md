# Corporate Data Science
This talk was presented at csv,conf,v3 (https://csvconf.com/) on May 2, 2017 in Portland OR, and at ODSC-East (https://www.odsc.com/boston) on May 5, 2017 in Boston, MA.


## Abstract
Data scientists need to work on almost every aspect of a business. If a team is built only by "pattern matching‚Äù current (or idealized) members, then it will only be great at solving well-understood existing problems‚Äîand it will likely flounder as the business makes increasingly complex asks. This creates the pernicious conclusion that it‚Äôs tough to get a return on data science investments. 

Some of the most important benefits that data science teams can deliver are creative and novel solutions. The key to success when exploring uncharted territory is to have a diverse team: one with a wide-ranging background of experiences, demographics, areas of specialization, computer languages (and natural languages too!), diplomas (don‚Äôt hire only PhDs!), favorite approaches and algorithms, etc. To build strong data science teams (and to set them up for long-term success), it is crucial to optimize their makeup across many dimensions and to instill in them the importance of caring deeply about data assets (from data collection and security, to ethics and interpretability). 

This will be a useful session for those already working in industry who want to get better ROI from data science, teachers who want to get a better understanding of what hiring managers look for, students seeking out what to learn in order to be better positioned for data science work, and for data scientists to find out what to advocate for when hiring and how to improve their teams' effectiveness.
